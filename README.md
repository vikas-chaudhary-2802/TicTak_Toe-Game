Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python's Tkinter library.

How to Play
Objective: The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols (either 'X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal on the game board.

Starting the Game: The game starts with Player 1 ('X') making the first move. Players take turns placing their symbols on an empty spot on the board by clicking on that spot.

Winning: The game ends when one player successfully aligns three of their symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or when the board is full without a winner.

Scoring: Each game win earns the winning player a point. In case of a tie, both players receive a tie point.

Play Again: After a game ends, you can choose to play again by clicking on the "Play Again" button.

Game Controls
Left-click on an empty spot on the board to place your symbol ('X' or 'O').
Implementation Details
The game is implemented using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.
The game logic is handled using Python's NumPy library.
The graphical elements such as the board grid, X's, O's, and gameover screen are drawn on a Tkinter Canvas.
